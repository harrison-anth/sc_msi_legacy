# Intratumoral heterogeneity in microsatellite instability status at single cell resolution

## Repository information 

This repository contains the final results and code used to generate it for our recently submitted manuscript. We will archive this github repository after the manuscript is published. 

To access the computational pipeline associated with this research, SC-MSI, please reference the following repository (https://github.com/harrison-anth/sc_msi). We chose to separate the two, as 
the legacy repository contains thousands of txt files related to the results of the manuscript, and older code not needed to run SC-MSI.
